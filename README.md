<p id="description">There are numerous potential causes of pneumonia infection a deadly lung illness. Infections with bacteria viruses or fungi can result in pneumonia. Pneumonia is the eighth most common cause of mortality in the US and is the biggest cause of death in children under the age of five worldwide. This project's Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can determine whether a patient has pneumonia by analysing the patient's X-ray image potentially saving the lives of many people. The F1-Score for the Deep Learning model created for this project is 0.91.</p>
